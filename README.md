## Introduction

This easy-to-use note-taking application allows the user to write and save notes in order to better arrange and document memos for work or study.

This application uses npm packages `express` and `uuid`, uses `Express.js` middleware and is deployed with `Heroku`.

I made this app in order to learn how to use various middleware, such as `express.json`, `express.urlencoded` and `express.static`, and finally mounted and unmounted middleware with `express.use`.

## Usage
